PCCLIB is a library for converting between the Gregorian calendar and the PCC.
It works, finally, but be aware that it doesn't actually provide conversion functions.
Instead, it provides versions of ENCODE-UNIVERSAL-TIME and DECODE-UNIVERSAL-TIME appropriate
to the PCC.

If you haven't a clue what any of that means, this is probably not the project for you.  Just sayin'.

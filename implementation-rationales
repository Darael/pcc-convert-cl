Having reduced to a four-century cycle:
Get which century.  If the century-elapsed count is >= 3, use special-case
handling for the fourth (skip directly to the four-year-cycle stage). For the
other three possibilities, adjust if need be for non-leap-year in 91 (if
year of interest is 91 or >= 92, which is to say the fouryear-elapsed count is
21 or >=22).

That means we can write separate leap-year handler and non-leap-year handler,
and use a four-year-cycle-handler to stitch them together, with a
century-handler stitching those together and a four-century handler matching
those.  Since the pattern doesn't continue, we can stop there.

Four year cycles start on year zero.  That way, arithmetic is doubly 
simplified: No special cases for the extra day, since it occurs in the last
month of the last year, and the year value can easily be a years-elapsed
value, which is easier for implementer.
